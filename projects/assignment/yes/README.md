# Yes

## Background
yes â€“ be repetitively affirmative

yes is a program that prints y infinetely.
It's used to bypass prompts that ask for y/n

You can also use it to print any other string you want infinitely

## Task

I want you to write a program that does the following:
- if the user doesn't provide any arguments, print 'y' infinite times
- if the user provides an argument, print the argument infinite times

This program should be 1 - 20 LOC (lines of code)

Mine was 15 lines including empty lines

## Example Execution 

```txt
$ ./yes
y
y
y
y
y
y
...

$ ./yes josh
josh
josh
josh
josh
josh
josh
...

```
