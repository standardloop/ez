# Two Largest

## Background
It's easy to find the largest element in an array, but finding the two largest make you think a little more.

For example, we could say the array represents weather, and maybe you want to know the 2 hottest days of the week.

## Task

I want you to write a program that does the following:
- The array defined statically (no user input)
- Your program should be linear space and time complexity
- Prints the two largest elements in a give array.

This program should be 30 - 100 LOC (lines of code)

Mine was 56 lines including empty lines

## Example Execution 

```txt
# int arr[] = {0, 13, -4, 8, 100, 4, 84, 5, 32, 9, -11, 4, 74}; // inside the C code
$ ./two-largest
Largest: 100, Second Largest: 84
```
